*** Stop Auto Update for iMacros 8.9.7 because the newer version no longer supports some features.

## Why iMacros 8.9.7 not latest 9.0.3?
- Full support for window interface
- Full support for must javascript language
- Stable & Secure with good feedbacks according to imacros.net
- Latest version isn't secure and has bad feedbacks and has many bugs and not stable to work on.


## How to use?

1. Get the source

```
git clone https://github.com/jinzocode/imacros-scripts.git
```

2. Copy & Paste the script you want inside ``iMacros/Macros`` folder

3. Create your own config you will find examples inside datasources folder. (Each script has custom datasource file or more)

### *** Notes

- Don't use play loop as JavaScript itself has loops.
